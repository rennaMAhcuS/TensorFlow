We'll start this week with a topic that'll build the foundation for the final
projects we're going to do, **classification**. This would be one of the first
few topics you'd learn in an introductory AIML course (which you might've
taken/ will take in future). We also need to build basic concepts of machine
learning like loss functions, training a model etc. Resources are provided
at the end.

From the first chapter, we're expecting you to know
1) Loss Functions.
2) What are models? How are they fitted on a given data?

After reading the intro, you might wonder how classification fits into the
broader landscape of machine learning problem types.

From the second chapter (linear classifiers), we're expecting you to know
1) What's classification? In which of the final projects might we use it?
2) Does using vectors to classify data (which can be anything) make sense?
3) On what basis is a given linear classifier classifying data (which are
   points in nd-space)? What kind of shape does the boundary between two
   classes of data look like (atleast for 1/2/3 dimensions)?

There's some math behind this, you need not know every mathematical
detail. If you're getting an intuition of the stuff above, you're good to
go.

You also have few python assignments coming up this week, so we're expecting
you to give these atleast the first 2-3 days (learn it thoroughly). You can do
these and the python assignments in parallel too if it takes longer time. A
good understanding of this concept will give you a good foundation and serve as
a good introduction to machine learning!

If you're done with these, you can try reading about perceptron algorithm
which trains a binary classifier on a given data.

Resources (more will be added):
* Notes for first two chapters are provided in this directory.
* [Here](https://shorturl.at/LoKqd) are lectures from MIT Open Learning Library if you prefer video based
  learning. We're not expecting you to watch all the videos fully, you can skip
  a few/ watch at 2x etc. But make sure you understand the things described
  above :)
